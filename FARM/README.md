🌟 Overview
The FARM stack is designed for high performance and flexibility, leveraging:

FastAPI: A fast and modern Python framework for building APIs.
React: A JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for scalable data management.
Docker: For containerization and simplified deployment.
🚀 Key Highlights
FastAPI Basics: Build high-performance APIs with Python, including routing, data validation, and interactive API documentation.
React Deep Dive: Learn to create dynamic frontends using React components, state management, and lifecycle methods.
MongoDB Essentials: Discover flexible schema design and how to manage data with this NoSQL database.
Dockerization: Learn how to containerize your FARM stack application for consistent and portable development environments.
To-Do App Project: A hands-on implementation of a FARM stack project, showcasing CRUD functionality, API endpoints, and Docker orchestration.
🛠️ Setup and Installation
Backend: FastAPI
Install FastAPI: pip install fastapi[all]
Create a FastAPI app and run it with Uvicorn.
Frontend: React
Initialize a React app: npx create-react-app my-app
Start the development server: npm start
MongoDB
Use MongoDB Atlas or a local instance for database storage.
Connect your FastAPI app to MongoDB using motor.
Docker
Use Docker and Docker Compose to containerize the app.
Start all services with a single command: docker-compose up --build
